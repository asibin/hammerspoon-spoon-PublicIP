--- === PublicIP ===
---
--- Simple spoon for fetching your current public IP address and geolocation and displaying it in menubar.
--- Menubar is displaying IP, ISP and country. Useful if you are switching between VPNs
--- at regular basis or are just interested in your current ISP on public WIFI. Can be manually
--- refreshed by clicking on menubar widget or can be auto-refreshed each time network IP4 is 
--- changed.
---
--- Supports 2 modes of output - terse and normal. If terse variable is set to true it will display
--- short output with only current countryCode with further info available on click. Selecting any
--- of the values from dropdown (in both terse and normal mode) will copy that value to clipboard.
--- 
--- This spoon uses free geolocation service provided by awesome ip-api.com. Big thanks to 
--- them for making this possible. Please consider supporting them by subscribing to their PRO tier.
--- Commercial use of ip-api.com service is prohibited without PRO service plan. Use at your own
--- risk.
--- 
--- Example configuration:
--- ```
--- hs.loadSpoon("PublicIP")
--- spoon.PublicIP.terse = true
--- spoon.PublicIP.refreshIP()
--- ```
---
--- where 'spoon.PublicIP.terse' is optional in case you want to change to short layout
---
--- In case you want to watch for IPv4 address changes and auto refresh after loading spoon also add:
--- ```
--- function networkChangedCallback(store, keys)
---     hs.timer.doAfter(10, function()
---     spoon.PublicIP.refreshIP()
---   end)
--- end
--- 
--- n = hs.network.configuration.open()
--- n:monitorKeys("State:/Network/Service/.*/IPv4", true)
--- n:setCallback(cb)
--- n:start()
--- ```
--- 
--- In case you want to watch both IPv4 and IPv6 you need to monitor keys for IPv4 and IPv6.
